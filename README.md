# Rugby Project Overview

This project is a personal initiative for my son, who is an avid rugby fan. It utilizes **React** and **Node.js** to manage JSON data on a local PC. 

## Features

- **Admin Section**: This section allows for the addition of rugby players from the All Blacks team,
- enabling the assignment of an availability status: **Available**, **Injured**, **Retired**, or **Needing Work**.
  
- **Selectors Section**: Family members can select players they believe will be chosen for the upcoming international
- game against the All Blacks. Each family member's selections are recorded in a separate JSON file, along with their name and predictions.

- **Official Team Input**: An admin interface is provided for entering the official team selected by the team coach.
- This feature includes a breakdown of player performance compared to the officially released team. The project implements a point system to display outcomes.

## Current Status

The initial phase of the project has been partially completed, with some fine-tuning still required. 
Development is currently focused on enhancing the selectors section.
